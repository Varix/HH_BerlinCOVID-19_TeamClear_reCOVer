# HH_BerlinCOVID-19_TeamClear_reCOVer
Team Clear's Entry for Hacking Health Berlin COVID-19, Mobile app reCOVer for accessing tests for patients and contact tracing.


What is the problem you're trying to solve?
Challenge 3: Privacy-first contact tracing and digital epidemiology
--- Streamlining at home testing for patients and collecting secure anonymous data
How you plan to solve it?
Create an online platform + wellness app that can be integrated with sites like CoEpi for anonymous and secure data collection, in addition to self assessment tools.

A successful platform will be simple, visual, and informative. The following would be possible:
Outcome 1:
Patients can answer questions about their symptoms, location, etc and see recommended actions. They can easily track their logins on their phone and see how symptoms are changing.

Outcome 2:
Secure and anonymous contact tracing allows the patient to stay in the know of their area and receive notifications when new cases pop up in their vicinity

Outcome 3:
information like location, age, and test results are anonymously collected through the platform and collected into a large database.

Outcome 4:
Test results and recorded symptoms can be released to medical health professionals with the consent of the patient.
